        <p>I adore Tigers! They combine beauty and strenth, cuteness and danger at the same time. Tigers are same strong as the lions but their apperance is brighter and more attractive. And as real cats tigers are smooth, gracefull and that is why so dangerous.

      <h2>Knitting</h2>
      <p>Have you ever thought about knitting like a proccess of creating something from nothing? It is really incredable!!! At the beginning there are just a couple of niddles and a skein of thread. And loop after loop, chain after chain it become a piece of clothes!</p>

      <p> Can you imaging that the whole world around you can be introduced just with two actions: on and off? Every digital technology has a code which is based only two contidions: ON or OFF, YES or NO. What a magic of digits!
